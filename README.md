# Mike's Midwestern Delicacies

This is my first real project from The Odin Project, and honestly, it came out way cleaner than I expected.  
It's a simple HTML website that shows off three classic Midwestern recipes:

- Funeral Potatoes  
- Chili  
- Buckeyes  

Each page has an image, ingredients, step-by-step instructions, and a little personal backstory — the kind of stuff you'd hear from someone standing next to a crockpot at a family gathering.

This project helped me get comfortable with basic HTML structure, file paths, linking between pages, and keeping everything organized in separate folders. No CSS yet — just raw HTML, Midwest charm, and enough comfort food to survive an Ohio winter.
