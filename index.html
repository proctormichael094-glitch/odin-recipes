      This dish reminds me of my sister. She always makes it on a random day of the week,
      and I would sneak when she wasn't looking to grab a big scoop. It's just that dogone
      good!

      This is one of my favorite meals on a cold winter day, and we get pretty brutal
      winters here! My dad always made this at least once a week growing up. I still
      can remember the aroma lingering through the house making my mouth water in delight!
      Then my tongue smacking the roof of my mouth in pure bliss.

<!-- Personal Story -->
  <p>
    No <em>Midwestern</em>recipe page would be complete without this delicious sweet treat.
    Me being an Ohio native, I grew up with this simple dessert in my house most days of
    the year. If you're looking for a low calorie dessert, this isn't the one for you. This 
    is the kind of dish that not only raises your spirits, but also your blood sugar! Still 
    it always reminds me that joy can be found in the struggle.
