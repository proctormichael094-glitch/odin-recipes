    <h2>A savory classic dish with a twist!</h2>

<!-- Recipe Backstory -->
    <p>
       Chili goes way back to the 1800s when cowboys were out working on the trail and
       tossing together whatever they had. From day one it was basically an experiment
       people slapped it on tamales, dumped it over cornbread, even used it for early
       Frito pies. So honestly, chili never had one “correct” version.

       That's why when people act like the way we make it in the Midwest is weird, I just
       laugh. This dish was freestyled since the beginning. We're not doing anything
       crazy. We're just carrying on the tradition of “cook what you've got and make it
       taste good.”
